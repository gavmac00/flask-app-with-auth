    "description": "A mesmerizing painting that captures the ethereal beauty of a compass jellyfish in oranges, yellows, and silver against a backdrop of deep black cardstock. This stunning artwork takes you on a journey to the depths of the ocean, where the mysterious and graceful jellyfish drift through the inky abyss. I was experimenting with some metallic paint for the compass jellyfish. The jellyfish can be pictured to be floating in the ocean during the night.",
